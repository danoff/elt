Grammar Worksheet

10:40 - 10:45
* Went over may vs maybe
** May is a modal auxiliary verb that = possibility or permission
** Maybe is an adverb = perhaps/there is a chance
*** He may get 100% on the quiz means there is a possibility he will get 100%.
*** Maybe he will get 100% on the quiz means perhaps he will get 100%, main difference being maybe is modifying "will" while may is modal auxiliary verb helping the verb "get". It is a small difference.
