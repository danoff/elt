Afterwards students compared their results today with those of last block to compare their scores and see what they had forgotten. Next they worked in pairs to try and find the exact answer for each question (without notes). Finally, we reviewed the answers as a class and I distributed the answer key to them.</p>
         <p>2 | Introduce new syllabi
	 <br/>
         * Students read syllabi independently taking notes, and coming up with 1 to 3 individual questions. First the checked with their partners for answers, then we disussed them as a class.
	 <br/>
         * Finally, the instructor walked through the syllabus highlighting the most important sections for the class.</p>

     </td>
     <td><p>1 | Replay questions introduction
	 <br/>
         * Gave the students a worksheet asking for some of the key ideas from Chapter 12 about "Replay Questions" and then we discussed them for a bit, focusing on examples of how the same English word can have very different meanings, dependant on context.</p>
         <p>2 | Reviewed yesterday's reading TOEFL Simulation
	 <br/>
         * Gave students a paper version of the question about Beowulf. First they read independently and tried to answer the questions, then they reviewed with their partners and finally we reviewed as a class, focusing especially on why wrong answers were wrong to clarify the strategy of eliminating wrong answer choices if you are not totally sure about the answer.

         * Reviewed the multiple choice questions from lesson 8 and then had the students individually race through the synonym matching exercise from chaper 9. I was surprised by how well they did after I only gave them a minute or so to work.</p>
         <p>2 | Continued Reviewing the Advanced/Integrative Reading/Writing worksheet from last block on "Dark Matter".
	 <br/>
         * This Dark Matter material is extremely dense, and it has taken much longer than I planned for the students to complete. It is a good experience for them to be working with this high level material and accessing it, just it is a slow process. Accordingly, the Digital Storytelling activity has been pushed back.</p>
